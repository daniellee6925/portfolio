    description:
      "Developed a hierarchical classification model that identifies retinal diseases from medical images, achieving 85% recall in disease identification and 82% accuracy in classifying specific conditions.\nThe project involved building and training models using EfficientNet and Vision Transformers and was evaluated with the help of TensorBoard.\nTo optimize the model for deployment, model's size was reduced while maintaining high performance, achieving an average inference time of 0.5 seconds.\nThe final model was deployed on Hugging Face Spaces, allowing users to interact with the classifier via a simple, intuitive interface built with Gradio...",

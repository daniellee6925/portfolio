# üìò **Learning of the Day**

   1. What is the transformer architecture?
   2. Transformer architecture has an encoder and decoder, each with 3 main layers
   3. The first layer is the embedding layer which converts tokens into vectors. Positional embeddings are added to capture the order of the tokens
   4. The second layer is multi-head attention. Attention scores are calculated by comparing queries to keys and it determines how much focus each token should receive from the current token. Multi-head attention allows the model to capture relationships simultaneously. 
   5. The last layer is the feedforward network which applies the non-linear transformations, 
   6. The encoder and decoder communicate through the cross attention mechanism where the encoder can be seen as the ‚Äòcomprehension‚Äô module which understands and processes the input and the decoder can be seen as the ‚Äògeneration‚Äô module which produces the output 
   7. The main advantages of the transformer architecture compared to RNNs are efficient training since it processes tokens in parallel, the ability to capture long range dependencies, and scalability. 
   1. Broadcasting Rules
      1. Each tensor has at least one dimension
      2. When iterating over the dimension sizes, starting at the trailing dimension, the dimension sizes must either be equal, one of them is 1, or one of them does not exist
   2. If the tensors are broadcastable
      1. Prepend 1 to the one with the smaller dimension and the resulting size will have the larger dimension
   3. Quantization
      1. Reducing the precision of numerical values of the model parameters to decrease the model size and computational requirements. This results in faster inference and lower power consumption 
      2. Uses 8-bit integers rather than 32-bit float

# üìò **Learning of the Day**

   1. How do generative language models work?
   2. Generative language models work by predicting the next work given an input sequence. Based on a list of possible output words, the model chooses the word with the highest probability. The models are auto regressive which means that the output of the model is feedback in as an input to predict the next word until it reaches an EOS token 
   3. What is fine-tuning and why is it important?
   4. Fine-tuning is taking a pre-trained model created for general and broad range tasks and re-training it for specific tasks such as question answering. New layers and datasets can be added to train the model on a new objective with a loss function reflecting the objective. 
   1. LSTM 
   2. LSTMs try to overcome the issues of short term memory and vanishing/exploding gradients of vanilla RNNs. It is done by keeping track of a long term memory through the cell state. 
   3. There are 3 gates that keep track of the long term memory. The forget gate determines which information should be forgotten from the cell state. The input gate determines which information should be added to the cell state. The output gate (sigmoid) controls what part of the cell state should be used to compute the hidden state and passed onto the next step. 
      1. Forget: controls past memory 
      2. Input: controls new (short term) memory
      3. Output: controls the combination of past and new memory
   4. You can think of this process as a teacher telling the student which information is important to retain and what should be forgotten 
   5. Cell state update
      1. Cell state = Forget gate * prev cell state + input gate * candidate cell state 
      2. Hidden state = output gate * cell state 
   6. Pros:
      1. Handles long-term dependencies
   7. Cons:
      1. Slower and difficult to train
      2. Still not good at very long sequences

   1. What is a token in LLM context
   2. Token is the single unit of text that is used as an input to LLMs. Tokens are converted to numerical format and it is used for training the model and for inference.

A common tokenizer is Byte pair encoding which is used for the GPT models

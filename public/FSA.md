**Learning of the day (7/18)**  
- Overall: Group Term Life and Supplemental benefits 
- Various provisions - Benefit, Plan, Taxation, Regulation
- Key Question: Imputed Income Calc (numerical question)
    - all benefits over $50,000 & subtract EE contributions
    - for supplemental, not subject to section 79 if:
        - 1. no employer subsidies 
        - 2. straddle test - premium step rates are all above or all below 
    - AD&D and terminated EE don't have imputed benefits 
    - EE contribution should be excluded based on expected claim rates
        - There can be a credibility blend btwn actual and expected 
        - Unisex rates can be calculated based on % blen btwn M/F
        - Round rates to the nearest cent for each calc (not at the end)

**Learning of the day (7/20)**  
- Overview
    - **PBMs and Formulary**
    - **Plan development cycle and teams invovled**
    - **Setting premium rates: 4 methods - Tabular, density, Build up, Simulation**
    - **Rerating**
    - **Block rating and asset share approach**
- Formulary 
    - 3 types
        - 1. closed: only drugs listed
        - 2. open: pref and non-pref
        - 3. Tier: diff lvls 
- Value based Insurance Design (VBID)
    - high value drugs that can help condition (prevent higher costs later) are given better cost sharing 

- Mandatory Generic, "Dispense as Written DAP"
    - requires pharmacy to dispense brand rather than generic

- PBMs and Pharmacy Networks
    - Generic discounts based on MAC (maximum allowed cost)
    - MAC discounts from Avg Wholesale Price (AWP) from 50~80%
    - 2 primary models for contract with 3rd party payers
        - Transparent model: pass through all costs 
        - Traditional model: PBM keeps spread

- Rebeates
    - Manufactures pay to PBMs for formulary placement
    - Key factor to determine negotiating leverage.
        - number of lives represented
        - ability to move mkt share to preferred drugs 
        - consistency of plans's response to manufacture's actions 

- **Plan cost calc**
    - Ingredient cost + admin fee + dispensing fee - rebates

- Setting premium rates 
    - fundamental nature of process
        - 1. measure past
        - 2. adapt it to future
        - 3. project to future to determine rate levles
    - considerations
        - 1. market 
        - 2. existing products
        - 3. distribution
        - 4. regulation
        - 5. strategic plans, profit goals 

- Rate Structure used today (General)
    - Age
    - Duration
    - Gender, marital/parental status
    - Occupation
    - Geography
    - Other (smoking)
- Community rating 
    - ACA mandate 
        - Age (3:1)
        - Tobacco (1.5:1)
        - Area
        - Family structure/Tier
        - Plan (benefits)

- Method 1: Tabular
    - long term, non-inflation sensitive (Disability Insurance)
        - NP = prob claims x avg cost x discount factor x survival prob
        - AC = claim x prob still alive x discount factor 

    - Technique to model benefits 
        - Monte Carlo: based on random numbers
        - Markov Proces (chain): linear algebra model where claimants's state changes over time
        - Multiple, contingent decremental actuarial commulation functions (calculus and such)
    
- Method 2: Build Up 
    - "Cost Model"
    - Sensitive to inflation
    - Sum of a number of individual pieces, each has its own calculation
    - good for calculating impact of copys

- Method 3: Density Function
    - "Continuance" or "Continuation function"
    - Total claim of an individual in a year
    - Size of claim = number of days of claim x amount per da
    - Good for calculating impact of deductibles and out of pocket limits
    - Difficult for copays  
        - approx copay using build-up approach
        - interpolate between 2 curves (one with copay and one without)

- Method 4: Simulation
    - stochastic model based on Monte Carlo Simulation
    - future claim level is a random fluctuation from the avg claim level
        - 1. Develop "Expected" value based on whole block's experience
        - 2. Expected Value modified for information about the individual
        - 3. simulate random statistical fluctuation
    - Advantages
        - Examine whole distribution of future results, over whole portfolio
        - Allows extensive relationship between model values
    
- Rerating 
    - 1. Gather Exp
        - incurred claims and earned premium
        - use runout basis rather than financial
            - Method A: incurred cliams + reserves table 
            - Method B: income statement 
    - 2. Restate Exp
        - adjust for avg rate in exp. vs current
        - adjust past exp to be on current level
        - **Policy Reserve Considerations** (Must Consider ALL Fund Methods)
            - **M**edical Rerating - absence of policy reserves
            - **C**onsistent A:E analysis - w/, w/o policy reserves 
            - **A**ctual loss ratio (w/o reserves) should not be compared to expected LR 
            - **L**evel premium constant over life of the policy
            - **L**TC and DI carry substantial policy reserves
            - **F**actor for policy reserve calculated and added to already calculated reservee factor
            - **M**orbidity recognized as additional at time of rate increase (new benefit rather than recalc all previous)
    - 3. Proj past results to future 
        - Covered Population, Duration, Benefits, Claim Costs, Leveraging, Healthcare reform, other
    - 4. compare projected against desired results
        - rate change needed to make predicted results match the desired
        - **needed rate change = (projected LR / Desired LR) - 1**
        - increasing rates impacts assumptions and becomes recursive
        - Expense and profit considerations
        - **rate inc = ((PV of claims / required LR) - PV of Prem / PV of prem for yr 2-4)
    - 5. apply regulatory and management adjustments

- Rating Philosophy
    - Blue Cross and HMO 
        - short term profit horizon
        - "Block Rating"
    - DI, LTC
        - Asset share model - long term projection treated as a closed block
    - Commercial Medical
        - price using asset shares but assumptions aren't realistic over long term
    - ACA considerations
        - ACA compliant plans must use block rating (except GF plans)
        - Must use single risk pool
            - Uniform rate review template (URRT)

- Block Rating (short time horizon)
    - Annual cliam cost claculated 
    - add expense and profit
    - adjust for changes when calculating rates 
    - Normalize - translate claim costs into age/gender neutral rates 
    - final claim costs - apply demogrpahic rate relativities

    - **G = N (1 + E^N) + E^F / (1 - E^G)**
        - N: Net prem (claim cost)
        - E^N: expenses % of Net 
        - E^F: expenses fixed
        - E^N: expenses % of gross prem
        - G: Gross prem

- Asset Share approach (granular)
    - calc done for representative rating cells
    - PY: simple but to translate to financial forecast, partial  year calc needed
    - CY: greater rigor regarding premium modes (how freq prems are paid), freq of policy issue 
    - Elements 
        - Exposure
        - Revenue
        - Claim
        - Capital
        - Expense and profit targets


**Learning of the day (7/21)**  
- **Pricing Group Insurance: What consists of gross premium and how to price them**
    - Increasing gross premium
    - Rate tier structure
    - Experience rating large groups

- Gross Premium consists of 
    - Claim costs 
    - Expenses (Administrative, comissions, sales)
    - Premium and other taxes
    - Contributions to surplus: reserves (reflects risk and profit expectation)
    - Miuns investment income 

- Administrative expenses 
    - Activity based allocation: estimate of use
    - Functional Expense allocation: how time is allocated for activity categories
    - Multiple allocation methods: hybrid 

- Pricing Assumptions
    - Internal: resources used, company accounting system 
    - External: studies by industry associations, data may not be accurate 

- Manual Premium Rates
    - rates that would be charged in absence of credibility given to past experience

- Group Specific Adjustments 
    - premium rates - may be expressed as percentage of manual rates 
    - large group -based on experience
    - other groups - based on manual rates, adjustments 
    - new business discounts: encourage group to change carriers 
    - jumbo groups - may provide marketing advantage
    - self insured groups - loadings (additional charges to pure premium) based on cost of admin and stop loss insurance
    - Underwriters responsbile for developing customer's rates 

- **Estimating Life Claim Costs**
    - developing expected mortatlity costs 
    - adjusting expected mortality costs 
    - related coverage considerations

- premium structure
    - expected claim cost + margin for deviation + expense +  risk charge + profit charge
    - rates: expressed as avg monthly premium per $1,000 insured
- Gross premium 
    - NP x (1-E^N) + E^F / (1-E^G)
    - NP / LR if E^N = E^F = 0

- Developing expected mortality costs 
    - Industry studies (SOA, etc.)
        - mortality for general population worse than group plans
    - Company experience
        - determine number of claims per unit exposed
    - Changes in mortality 
    - Reinsurance
    - conversions to individual life policies 
        - conversion charge for adverse selection 

- **Adjustments to expected mortality** (Life Manual Cost RISE Or Decline)
    - **L**ifestyle factors 
    - **M**arketing considerations
    - **C**ontribution schedules
    - **R**egional factors 
    - **I**ndustry factors 
    - **S**ize factors and volume adjustments
    - **E**ffective date adjustment
    - **O**ptions for plans
    - **D**isability factors

- other coverages
    - Dependent Life - expected claims not as favorable
    - AD&D - industry and gender important factors
    - Group Universal Life (GUL) - EE pay all
    - Living Benefits 
        - LTC: 2% monthly 
        - Catastrophic: 25% single - difficult to define diseases
        - Terminal: 25-50% single

**Learning of the day (7/22)**  
- Estimating medical claim costs
- Overview
    - **How to collect data**
    - **how to normalize and project data**
    - **how to calculate gross and net claim costs**
- Data Sources
    - Own experience if credible 
        - 1. Medical Claim Systems
        - 2. PBM data
        - 3. Premium billing and elligibility data
        - 4. Provider contract system 
- Variables to be considered 
    - Financial info: type of claim
    - Experience period: seasonality, basis
    - Exposure basis: num of emp, contracts, etc.
    - Frequency of data collection
    - **How much, when, who, how often?**

    - **B**enefit plan
    - **O**ther risk adjusters
    - **C**haracteristics of group

- Trend: unit cost, utilization, mix of service
- Secular Trend: percent change only from factors that affect first dollar, 100% benefits (long-term)
- Leveraging - deduct and copays 

- Methods of Adjusting Manual Base Rates
    - Claim Probability Distributions (CPD)
        - Use: deductibles, coninsurance, OOP
        - Users: traditional insurance, HDHP, Major medical with DDL, CI, and OOP
        - Calc: summarize annual claims on pm basis, group members in cost ranges
    - Actuarial Cost Models 
        - Use: copay and limits
        - Users: HMOs, PPOs, POS and other
        - Calc: 1/12 of the product of annual freq x allowed charges - copayments

- Small Group Considerations
    - HIPAA: 2- 50 EE's
    - ACA: 50-100 EE's
    - PACE act allows state to choose
    - majority of small groups do not offer group medical
    - Under ACA, groups 50-100 required to offer coverage or pay fee 
        - groups under 25 - offered temp tax credits for offering coverage
    - HIPPA
        - guaranteed acceptance and renewal
    - ACA
        - Essential Health Benefit, benefit (metal) tiers
        - Elimination of rating variables
        - Younger/healtier group subsidize older/less healthy groups

- Factors to consider to understand drivers of experience 
    - Financial Viability of group 
    - Industry/Occupation
    - Group size
    - Workers Compensation
    - Participation
    - Employer contributions

**Learning of the day (7/24)**  
- Overview
    - **Dental Coverage Info and Provider Reimbursement Method**
    - **How to calculate gross and net claim costs for dental claims**

- Data Sources
    - if credible, use your own exp data
    - if not credible (Dental CLaim Require Other)
        - **D**atabases - fee level info
        - **C**onsulting firms - utilzation stats
        - **R**einsurers/TPA - charge leven and util info
        - **O**ther carriers - actuarial memoranda and rate filings 

- Data Quality considerations: ASOP 23

- Claim Cost Factors
    - 1. The plan
    - 2. The network and reimbursement levels
    - 3. The insured population

- Dental Coverage
    - Highly discretionary (anti-selection)
    - Cost sharing: reduce cost, incentivize insured to choose less expensive coverage
    - Preventive care saves on total cost
    - May have annual and lifetime maximum (other than children for IFP/SG)

- Period of Coverage
    - Levearging impact of deductibles
    - Dampening impact of max limits (as annual max limit decrease, the impact of trend on expected claim cost decrease)

- Provider Reimbursement Methods
    - 1. Fee-for-service
        - Reasonable and Customary
        - lower of high percentile of national fees (reasonable) OR high percentile of local fees (customary)
        - permit "balance bill" 
    - 2. Dental PPO
        - insurer lists dentist in network for reduced fee schedule
        - Balance billing NOT allowed
        - Insures increase schedule every 2-4 years
            - constraints and spikes
        - fee schedule don't control util or intensity
    - 3. Capitation
        - Dental HMO plans
        - paid amount per member enrolled
        - capitation rate
            - 1. assumed util
            - 2. allowed average payment per service
        - providers may ask for downside protection (not penalized if cost/util higher than expect to avoid undertreating)
    - critical components of revenue are
        - patient payments for consinsurance
        - non-covered services 

- Discount Cards
    - not insurance, just discounted pricing
    - membership fee
    - Advantages to insurers: wider range of solutions provided, keep up with competiton, strengthen clout with dentists

- Care management
    - effectiveness depends on method used to reimburse
        - FFS: incentive to over-treat patients
        - Capitation Basis: incentive to under-treat patients
    - Preauthorization
        - manage util for FFS
    - Self-management
        - DHMOs use quality assurance mechanisms

- Claim Cost Factors 
    - Age and Gender 
    - Geographic Area
    - Group Size
    - Prior Coverage and Pre-Annoucement
        - no prior: high initial util
        - preannouncement: employee postpone and use later
    - Employee Turnover
        - higher turnover: higher util 
    - Occupation or Income 
        - Some professionals use more, related to benefit awareness
    - Contribution and Participation
        - Less participation, higher costs 

- ACA considertions 
    - Pedicatric not required (unless SG or IFP)
    - inclusion of maximum OOP provision
    - No Actuarial Value for stand-alone dental 
    - Little to no subsidy for stand-alone dental (reduce affordability)
    - Max OOP must be combined with medical and dental (when not stand-alone dental)
    - Hard to get dental with medical 

- Why get group?
    - group rate discounts and underwriting, pretax payroll deduction of premiums
    - Lots of anti-selection
    - lifetime deductible: keep coverage
    - Elimination (waiting) periods
    - particpation requirements
    - 'Cafeteria plan' selections - less anti-selection

- Experience Rating
    - Dental insurance more credible than medical at same group size
    - large claims and pooling not part of exp rating 


**Learning of the day (7/25)**  
- Overview
    - **What are the key components to Trend**
    - **How to calculate trends**

- 3 purposes of trend
    - financial reporting
        - determine financial peformance of a given period
    - pricing 
        - Trend calc basis
            - Eligible: bill charges before provider contracts or discounts
            - Allowed: eligible after provider contracts/discounts before cost sharing 
            - Net paid: bottom line after cost-sharing 
    - experience analysis
        - based on retrospective claims 
        - techniques to incorporate unreported claims 
            - use standard set of completion factors
            - equal runoff method: similar time in prior period

- **Component Method** (Use Past COst to Approximate Levels, U PS CO AL)
    - **U**tilization
    - **P**opulation shift
    - **S**tructural changes
    - **C**ost 
    - **O**ne-time changes
    - **A**lternative payment methods 
    - **L**everaging

- Core cost trend
    - rate of increase in the covered cost per service 
        - unit cost trend
        - severity
        - mix of services

- Core Utilization trend
    - utilization vary by weekday and holiday
        - Monday highest
        - Friday lowest
        - less prescriptions on wednesdays

- One time change
    - response to specific, one time events
        - return back to normal
            - flu season
            - weather (hurricane)
        - sustained change
            - legislation
            - internal changes: processes and procedures
    - New technology
        - 1. start up - util increase slowly
        - 2. catch up - highest util
        - 3. steady state
        - 4. transistion - new tech 

- population shifts
    - underlying population shift due to leaving/entering members
    - difficult to project for rapidly growing or new population
        - 1. project composiiton of new pop
        - 2. estimate pmpm based on util for similar members

- Structural Changes
    - changes in AV and insured's behavior
    - Benefit Rush-Hush-Crush
        - Rush: people rush to use benefits with outgoing plan 
        - Hush: less usage in the next
        - Crush: usage returns to normal, trend inflated 

- Alternative Payment Methods
    - Capitation
    - Global Budgets: similar to capitation but based on total population

- Leveraging
    - trend on allowed amounts different than trend on paid amount

- Monitorting
    - how accurate were the original trend 
    - which assumptions drive variation
    - how can process be modified to be more accurate
    - what other factors drove the trends

- Component trend analysis
    - common method but resource/data heavy
    - alternative - regression technique: based on pmpm costs, normalized for key factors

**Learning of the day (7/27)**  
- Overview
    - **Experience Rating: prospective & retrospective**
    - **Funding Methods**

- theoretical considerations
    - low frequency coverages
    - widely varying claim sizes
    - confidence interval
    - experience due to statistical fluctuation 
    - non-zero correlation between experience period and projection period
    - typical measure: number of lives covered

- practical considerations
    - regulatory restrictions - certain group sizes
    - competitive pressure
    - administrative and managerial units
    - added cost of experience ratiing and resulting gains
    - effect on existing business
    - management philosophy
    - internally self consistent

- Prospective
    - claims
        - first, develop estimate of incurred claims
        - second, adjust and calculate claim experience
        - incurred claims = Paid + (Ending Reserve - Starting Reserve)
    - Adjustments to reduce effects of random variation (pooling methods)
        - dampen random statistical fluctuations
        - catastrophic claim pooling
        - LR/Rate increase limits
        - Credibility weighting
        - multi-year averaging
        - combination
    - after pooling
        - rate basis considerations
        - Trend: factors impacting expected costs
            - changes in gov. programs
            - secular or cyclic trends in rates
            - mortality trends
            - utilization or cost trends in medical trend
            - changes in demographic characteristics
            - changes in benefits in the plan
            - antiselection opportunities by insureds
            - changes in insured, economic, financial env.
    - common retention items
        - expense loadings and ACA fees
        - deficit recovery charge - to recoup past losses in prior years
        - termination risk charge - in case policyholder in a deficit terminate contract
        - pooling charge
        - profit charge
        - investment income
        - explicit margin
    - risk associated with rate guarantees 
        - misestimation risk - locked into rates for a long period
        - trend risk 

- Retrospective
    - financial experience for past period to determine cost of insurance for that period
        - benefit of good experience and held accountable for adverse exp
    - **formula balance**
        - prior formula balance carried foward + premiums + investment earnings - claims charged - expenses charged - risk charge - premium stabilization reserve - profit
    - **claims charged**
        - claims paid + increase in reserves - pooled claims + pooling charge + conversion charge + claim margins
    - calculation
        - % of gross premmium = % of total premium

    - claim charges
        - modifications
        - specific stop loss claims removed
        - incurred claims in excess of aggregate stop-loss pooling removed
        - pooling charge added back in 
        - additional credibility pooling adjustments
        - add in excess claims for conversion privileges

    - Applicability
        - group size: certain level of resources needed
            - SG: for self funded only
        - contract provisions 
        - company polices and practices
        - company financial situation

- Funding Arrangements (MIS L RSR)
    - fully **i**nsured: insurer bears all risk
        - premum tax, subject to state laws
    - **R**eserveless plans: foregoes premium payments, reconciliate payment needed during termination
    - **M**inimum premium contracts: policyholder deposits funds to an account - claims paid from fund
        - very similar to stop-loss
    - **R**etrospective premium arrangements: policyholder takes part or all claim risk - reeduce risk charges and lower up-front premium
        - if exp worse - addtional premium due
        - if exp better - refund
    - **S**elf insured plans: employer takes on role as primary risk taker
        - usually with ASO (administrative services only) agreement
        - may purchase stop-loss
        - prem tax and ACA insurer fee avoided
        - no state laws, only federal (ERISA)
    - **L**evel-funded contracts: admin adjudicate and pays claims as long as premiums are paid
        - reconciliation at the end of year
            - incurred claims < than funded amount: surplus and receives admin credit
            - incurred claims > funded amount: stop loss covers 
        - attractive to small employers
    - **S**top loss contracts: excess of particular level
        - individual claims or aggregate levels

**Learning of the day (7/28)**  
- Overview
    - **Retrospective Rating: premium setting**
- Deficit Recovery Arrangement
    - deficit claims are accumulated and added to total premium in future
    - client side surplus includes all funds
    - insurer side surplus inlcudes profit/loss from deficit claims
- Unilateral
    - surplus go back to client, deficit is paid by insurer
    - client side surplus includes only positives
    - insurer side surplus inlcudes only negatives 
    - lowest profit for insurer
    - deficit premium is not included in total premium
- Bilateral
    - surplus go back to client, deficit is paid by client
    - client side surplus includes all funds (same ans deficit recovery)
    - insurer side surplus doesn't include any deficit claims (paid by client)
    - highest profit for insurer
    - deficit premium is not included in total premium

- Calculation
    - adjust premiums
        - get exp premium 
            - pmpm paid prem - pmpm pooled prem
        - total exp prem x (most recent pmpm/year t pmpm exp)
    - trend claims
        - based on trend and yrs away
    - calculate actual and target LR 
        target LR = 100% -expesne - fees - taxes - profit
        actual LR = trended claims / adjusted prem x credibility weighting 
        renewal rate increase = actual LR / Target LR - 1
    - calculate premium
        - base premium: prior year premium x (1 + rate inc)
        - deficit recovery prem = accumulated deficit / (# members x mths)
        - plus pooling premium


**Learning of the day (8/1)**  
- Overview
    - **Fundamentals of underwriting**

- Basics 
    - underwriting: risk selection and financial projections
    - inherent risk protection: employee risk pool is mostly healthy indv
    - Key risk factors: demo, industry, financial outlook, location, persistency, participation
    - prior experience: major factor to predict future costs 
    - ER and carrier shared goals: want low costs, high quality care, and satisfied EE
    - prior loss ratio/util
    - life and disability require larger case size than medical and dental

- ACA considerations
    - plans offered by Large ER must meet minimum value (MV)
    - plan must be affordable to avoid penalties
        - cost EE less than 9.5% of their income for EE only coverage
    - Cadilac Tax: penalties for rich benefit plans (no longer applicable)

- public exchanges
    - designed primarily for indv and small ER
    - Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements (ICHRAs)
        - substantial penalties for ERs who don't provide affordable coverage
        - past: QSEHRA
- private exchanges
    - insurer offer similar benefits and allow choice
    - established by consulting groups
    - creates antiselection risk

- Characteristics of group
    - age and gender
    - location
    - type of industry

            - require coverage to dependents to age 26
            - health insurance exchange - GI
    - Plan Design

- Evaluation
    - access to group specific experience data
    - meaningful past data and trends: check prior experience is accurate and reliable
    - know the risk and the existing carrier
    - group life & disability: volatile and pooling of large claims ins common

    - Medical
        - one year is adequate to project future claims 
        - adjust for discounts, cost containment programs, claim contorls
        - evaluating and projecting claim costs requires dealing with multiple choice scenarios
    - Medicare part D
        - prescription drug benefits 
        - ACA made option attractive to ERs who offer retiree coverage

        - alternatvies: fully-insured, self-funded, combination

- Renewal Underwriting
    - evaluating the case
        - review enrollment, antiselection, catastrophic, etc.
    - developing renewal recommendations 
        - new premium
        - alternative funding methods or plan design changes
    - revision underwriting
        - develop cost estimates for changes in group composition
    - renewal monitoring
        - track emerging exp

- Special risks
    - Association programs
        - association of individuals, multiple-employer trusts (METs)
        - ACA: eliminate need for association 
    - Taft-Hartley Groups
        - state law differ widely with eligibility rules, types of coverage, size req, EE contribution
    - Purchasing Alliances
        - two or more non-affiliated large groups

**Learning of the day (8/3)**  
- Overview
    - **Multiple Choice Environment Underwriting and Pricing**

- Multiple choice: ER allows EE to choose among 2 or more medical insurance options
    - Favorable: low risk EEs
    - Unfavorable: high risk (anti-selection)
- Why offer choice?
    - overall cost in a multiple choice env. > single choice env.
        - individuals choose to minimize OOP costs (cost of insurer or ER)
        - less economy of scale
        - communcations more complex, more admin and expenes
    - advantage
        - introduce new option
        - take advantage of favorable selection
        - encourage consumerism
        - implement a defined contribution concept
        - choice of the sake of choice
- What influence EE choice?
    - inertia
    - plan provisions and cost
    - EE and dependent demographics
    - ER actions and attitude
    - Eligibility for other health insurance coverage
    - Information about options
    - provider network attributes
    - insurer and admin issues
- Measuring selection and health status
    - insurers supplement traditional age/gender with risk and health status
        - health risk asssessment
        - risk adjusters
    - measure of selectionb - average health risk assessment
- Selection impact of EE contributions
    - Defined Contribution (DC)
        - ER fixed contribution, EE coveres remainder
        - insurer should consider EE selection when setting premiums
            - include selection loading
- Underwriting Techniques
    - Additional premium margin (selection loading)
    - EE contributions or plan design limits
        - limit spread in EE contributions 
        - limit spread in benefits
        - mix favorable cost sharing or benefit provisions
        - avoid options with selection potential for specific issues
        - participatiion requirements if multiple insurer offer choices
            - insurers can agree to redistribute income based on health status
        
- Pricing Strategies
    - 1. Determine AV of each benefit plan ignoring impact of selection
    - 2. estimate enrollemnt mix by plan option
    - 3. Estimate relative health status factor for each option
    - 4. Calculate preliminary selection adjusted rates for each option
        - step 1 x step 3 (for multiple)
    - 5. calculate the average selection load
        - avg step 4 / avg step 3 
    - 6. calculate blended selection adjusted rates
        - step 1 x step 5 (for single)
